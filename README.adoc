= PicNotes

== Introduction
This project provides a Python 3.x script for extracting note text from screenshots or other pictures via the https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/[Tesseract OCR engine]. The extracted text is written to an AsciiDoc file which makes it easy to search using utilities such as grep.

This script makes a lot of assumptions about the formatting and organization of your pictures. These assumptions might not suit everyone but this script can still be used as a starting point. The assumptions are the following:

  - Pictures are PNG format.
  - Notes are added to the pictures using blue text (`RGB=0/0/255`) on a yellow background (`RGB=255/255/185`). For best results, use a bold serif font.
  - Pictures are organized under a root folder named `pics`. Additional subfolders can be used to further organize pictures.
  - Pictures are named something like `screenshot-20200717191204.png` or `screenshot-20200717191204-more_info_here.png`. The `20200717191204` portion is a timestamp.

Many of these assumptions are because I use https://www.faststone.org/FSCaptureDetail.htm[FastStone Capture] to take screenshot notes.

To summarize, this utility will OCR scan the text of notes written onto a picture like...

image:examples\pics\screenshot-20200717191204.png[width=400]

...and then write that text (in this case `This is a note that is part of the picture.`) to an AsciiDoc file named `pic_notes.adoc` (like link:examples\pics\pic_notes.adoc[]).

== Status
Because this script makes so many use-case assumptions, there are no plans to version/release it like a normal project. Instead it is always recommended to use the latest repo version or create a fork and modify it to your needs.

== Requirements
This script was written with the Windows OS in mind although it should work on other operating systems. All dependencies should be listed in the main link:_Check_Dependencies.bat[] which is generated from link:install\dependencies.popyaml[]. Additionally, a Python requirements file is available at link:install\requirements.txt[].

== Install
This script is intended to be used as a command line utility. The current recommended installation method on Windows is to create a file named `picnotes.bat` in a directory that is on the PATH. Edit the file to include:

  @python <PATH_TO_PICNOTES_PY> %*

It should now be possible to run `picnotes --help` from the command line.

== Usage
The basic usage is to scan the pictures under a directory using the `picnotes scan` command. This will output a `pic_notes.adoc` AsciiDoc file in the scanned directory which will contain the scanned text and links to the pics; consider using https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[the AsciiDoctor.js Live Preview Chrome extension] for the best user experience when viewing this file.

More usage information is available from the `picnotes --help` command.

An example of the AsciiDoc notes file generated by the script is available at link:examples\pics\pic_notes.adoc[], it was generated by running `python picnotes.py scan --scandir examples\pics` from this directory.
